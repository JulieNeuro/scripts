PCA on 10 invariant's moments
=============================	

Methods
-------

1. Compute PCA on 10 Invariant's moments (pure shape descriptors) exclude moment_invariant_5 and moment_invariant_9. Quote (Sun et al. 2007 MICCAI): *"we noticed that I6 and I10 were presenting bimodal distributions for some sulci. One mode was made up of positive values and the other one of negative values. There is no apparent correlation between the shape and the sign of I6 and I10... These 12 invariants denoted by I1, I2, ..., I12"*

2. Color by tensor's invariant to interpret findings

Tensor's invariant assume that the lacune can be modeled by an ellipsoid. Computed invariants (Ennis 2006):

- fractional anisotropy (FA)
- linear anisotropy
- planar anisotropy
- spherical anisotropy
- Mode: diffusion tensor mode

PCA components from moments' invariant. It is a csv file of dimension: [n_lacunes x [lacune_id, PC1 (first component value), ..., PC10 (last component value)]]
And descriptive information about the PCA: explained variance ratio of the first two components is 81% + (PCA Loadings, weights vector).

Under subdirectory ``figures`` showing lacunes plotted in the **two first components** colored by FA, 
linear, planar and spherical anisotropy. File suffixed ``with-meshed-lacunes`` plot lacunes instead of simple dots.

Many dot plot of lacunes (as dot) plotted in the two first components, 
annotated with lacune_id and colored with tensor's invariant value.

		mnts-inv_pc12_spherical_anisotropy_with-meshed-lacunes.svg/svg
		
		mnts-inv_pc12_angle-with-perforator.png

The first two components explain 81% of the variance, the third component
explains 11%.

Here we plot the lacunes in the two first components of a PCA 9
Invariant's moments. To understand the distribution of the lacunes
in this shape's space, lacunes were then colored with tensor's invariant
(FA, linear, planar and spherical anisotropy). Remember that those
**tensor's invariant were NEVER (yet) considered in the computation of the PCA.**

Conclusions:

1. Invariant's moments capture the linear anisotropy (high top-left to low bottom right):

.. figure:: results_moments_invariant/figures/mnts-inv_pc12_linear_anisotropy_with-meshed-lacunes.png
	:scale: 200 %

	Scatter plot of lacunes within the two first components of a PCA on 9 Invariant's moments, colored by linear anisotropy.


2. Invariant's moments capture (with some outliers) the planar anisotropy (low top-left to high bottum right):

	:scale: 200 %

	Scatter plot of lacunes within the two first components of a PCA on 9 Invariant's moments, colored by planar anisotropy.

3. Lacunes' shape distribution move from **(1) top-left**: high linear anisotropy (high FA) and low
planar anisotropy to **(2) middle**: lower linear anisotropy and lower planar anisotropy (low FA) 
to **(3) bottom right**: low linear anisotropy and high planar anisotropy (high FA):

3. No visible link between the shape and its orientation with the nearset perforator.

Directly use tensor's invariant
===============================

Methods
-------

1. Compute PCA on 5 Tensor's invariant


PCA components from tensor's invariant. It is a csv file of dimension: [n_lacunes x [lacune_id, PC1 (first component value), ..., PC5 (last component value)]]
And descriptive information about the PCA: explained variance ratio.
::

	results_tensor_invariant/
		tnsr-inv_pca.csv
		tnsr-inv_pca_descriptive.csv

Many dot plot of lacunes (as dot) ploted in the two first components, 
annotated with lacune_id and colored with tensor's invariant value.

		tnsr-inv_pc12.pdf

2. Use only linear and planar anisotropy of tensor's invariant

Scatter plot of lacunes x-axis is linear anisotropy y-axis is planar.
File suffixed ``with-meshed-lacunes`` plot lacunes instead of simple dots.
File suffixed ``scaled`` plot lacunes whose dimension is scaled 
to the same global mean size.

		tnsr-inv_lin-plan_fa_with-meshed-lacunes_scaled.svg



Results
-------

PCA on 5 Tensor's invariant: PC1 capture the mode which demonstrate
that the main variability stem from change between planar anisotropic mode to linear anisotropic mode.
However this representation is not visually meaningful since it focuses
on few linear anisotropic lacunes.

.. figure:: results_tensor_invariant/figures/tnsr-inv_lin-plan_fa_with-meshed-lacunes_scaled.png
	:scale: 50 %

	Scatterplot of lacunes x-axis is linear anisotropy y-axis is planar, colored by fractionnal anisotropy.

No clear Relation with the perforator could be found.

.. figure:: results_tensor_invariant/figures/tnsr-inv_lin-plan_angle-with-perforator.png
	:scale: 200 %

	Scatterplot of lacunes (x-axis is linear anisotropy, y-axis is planar),
	colored by angle formed by the main orientation axis and the perforator.

Conclusion
==========

Most of the shape variability captured with moments' invariant could
be captured by linear and planar anisotropy which is based on an ellipsis modeling
of the shape of the lacunes.

No clear links with the nearest perforator could be found.
