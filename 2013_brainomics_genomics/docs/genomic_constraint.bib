abstract = {Meiotic recombinations contribute to genetic diversity by yielding new combinations of alleles. Recently, high-resolution recombination maps were inferred from high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data using linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns that capture historical recombination events. The use of these maps has been demonstrated by the identification of recombination hotspots and associated motifs, and the discovery that the PRDM9 gene affects the proportion of recombinations occurring at hotspots. However, these maps provide no information about individual or sex differences. Moreover, locus-specific demographic factors like natural selection can bias LD-based estimates of recombination rate. Existing genetic maps based on family data avoid these shortcomings, but their resolution is limited by relatively few meioses and a low density of markers. Here we used genome-wide SNP data from 15,257 parent-offspring pairs to construct the first recombination maps based on directly observed recombinations with a resolution that is effective down to 10 kilobases (kb). Comparing male and female maps reveals that about 15\% of hotspots in one sex are specific to that sex. Although male recombinations result in more shuffling of exons within genes, female recombinations generate more new combinations of nearby genes. We discover novel associations between recombination characteristics of individuals and variants in the PRDM9 gene and we identify new recombination hotspots. Comparisons of our maps with two LD-based maps inferred from data of HapMap populations of Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe (CEU) and Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI) reveal population differences previously masked by noise and map differences at regions previously described as targets of natural selection.},

abstract = {Grouping structures arise naturally in many statistical modeling problems. Several methods have been proposed for variable selection that respect grouping structure in variables. Examples include the group LASSO and several concave group selection methods. In this article, we give a selective review of group selection concerning methodological developments, theoretical properties and computational algorithms. We pay particular attention to group selection methods involving concave penalties. We address both group selection and bi-level selection methods. We describe several applications of these methods in nonparametric additive models, semiparametric regression, seemingly unrelated regressions, genomic data analysis and genome wide association studies. We also highlight some issues that require further study.},

@article{Chen2010,
abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified susceptibility loci from marginal association analysis of SNPs. Valuable insight into genetic variation underlying complex diseases will likely be gained by considering functionally related sets of genes simultaneously. One approach is to further develop gene set enrichment analysis methods, which are initiated in gene expression studies, to account for the distinctive features of GWAS data. These features include the large number of SNPs per gene, the modest and sparse SNP associations, and the additional information provided by linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns within genes. We propose a "gene set ridge regression in association studies (GRASS)" algorithm. GRASS summarizes the genetic structure for each gene as eigenSNPs and uses a novel form of regularized regression technique, termed group ridge regression, to select representative eigenSNPs for each gene and assess their joint association with disease risk. Compared with existing methods, the proposed algorithm greatly reduces the high dimensionality of GWAS data while still accounting for multiple hits and/or LD in the same gene. We show by simulation that this algorithm performs well in situations in which there are a large number of predictors compared to sample size. We applied the GRASS algorithm to a genome-wide association study of colon cancer and identified nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism and transforming growth factor beta signaling as the top two significantly enriched pathways. Elucidating the role of variation in these pathways may enhance our understanding of colon cancer etiology.},

@article{Silver2012,
abstract = {We present a new method for the detection of gene pathways associated with a multivariate quantitative trait, and use it to identify causal pathways associated with an imaging endophenotype characteristic of longitudinal structural change in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our method, known as pathways sparse reduced-rank regression (PsRRR), uses group lasso penalised regression to jointly model the effects of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), grouped into functional pathways using prior knowledge of gene-gene interactions. Pathways are ranked in order of importance using a resampling strategy that exploits finite sample variability. Our application study uses whole genome scans and MR images from 99 probable AD patients and 164 healthy elderly controls in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. 66,182 SNPs are mapped to 185 gene pathways from the KEGG pathway database. Voxel-wise imaging signatures characteristic of AD are obtained by analysing 3D patterns of structural change at 6, 12 and 24months relative to baseline. High-ranking, AD endophenotype-associated pathways in our study include those describing insulin signalling, vascular smooth muscle contraction and focal adhesion. All of these have been previously implicated in AD biology. In a secondary analysis, we investigate SNPs and genes that may be driving pathway selection. High ranking genes include a number previously linked in gene expression studies to $\beta$-amyloid plaque formation in the AD brain (PIK3R3,PIK3CG,PRKCAandPRKCB), and to AD related changes in hippocampal gene expression (ADCY2, ACTN1, ACACA, and GNAI1). Other high ranking previously validated AD endophenotype-related genes include CR1, TOMM40 and APOE.},

abstract = {We recently surveyed the relationship between the human brain transcriptome and genome in a series of neuropathologically normal postmortem samples. We have now analyzed additional samples with a confirmed pathologic diagnosis of late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD; final n = 188 controls, 176 cases). Nine percent of the cortical transcripts that we analyzed had expression profiles correlated with their genotypes in the combined cohort, and approximately 5\% of transcripts had SNP-transcript relationships that could distinguish LOAD samples. Two of these transcripts have been previously implicated in LOAD candidate-gene SNP-expression screens. This study shows how the relationship between common inherited genetic variants and brain transcript expression can be used in the study of human brain disorders. We suggest that studying the transcriptome as a quantitative endo-phenotype has greater power for discovering risk SNPs influencing expression than the use of discrete diagnostic categories such as presence or absence of disease.},

@article{Myers2007,
abstract = {It is widely assumed that genetic differences in gene expression underpin much of the difference among individuals and many of the quantitative traits of interest to geneticists. Despite this, there has been little work on genetic variability in human gene expression and almost none in the human brain, because tools for assessing this genetic variability have not been available. Now, with whole-genome SNP genotyping arrays and whole-transcriptome expression arrays, such experiments have become feasible. We have carried out whole-genome genotyping and expression analysis on a series of 193 neuropathologically normal human brain samples using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array Set and Illumina HumanRefseq-8 Expression BeadChip platforms. Here we present data showing that 58\% of the transcriptome is cortically expressed in at least 5\% of our samples and that of these cortically expressed transcripts, 21\% have expression profiles that correlate with their genotype. These genetic-expression effects should be useful in determining the underlying biology of associations with common diseases of the human brain and in guiding the analysis of the genomic regions involved in the control of normal gene expression.},
