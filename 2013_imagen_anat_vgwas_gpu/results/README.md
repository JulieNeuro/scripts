GENETIC FINDINGS
================

rsXXX75
-------

At the beginning I was a bit sad because of the allelic configuration available in our sample: I am so afraid of the “effet de levier” in the linear model that prevents to draw any conclusion… But it turns out that further investigations shed an interesting light on this SNP : we really need to spend some more time on it : it is a variant specific of the European population which was found to be linked to scz ,bipolar and vascular aspects and it is a MISsense variant (code for an impaired protein)
