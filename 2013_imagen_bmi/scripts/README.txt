12_cv_multivariate_BMI_image.py : 10-fold cross-validation "by hand" and computation of R2 value for various sets (alpha, l1_ratio), where alpha and l1_ratio are defined by two lists respectively, using ElasticNet or Parsimony

12_cv_multivariate_BMI_image_fast.py : 10-fold cross-validation "by hand" and computation of R2 value for various sets (alpha, l1_ratio), where alpha is fixed and l1_ratio is defined in a list, using ElasticNet or Parsimony

13_cv_mapreduce_multivariate_BMI.py : cross-validation through the algorithm mapreduce, using ElasticNet or Parsimony

14_extract_BMI_SNPs.py : effort to standardize data (bypass R extraction of original data and do it by Python)

15_cv_mltva_BMI.py : cross validation to be sent to Gabriel
